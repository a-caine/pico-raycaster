# Pico Raycaster

The aim of this project is to create a raycaster that can raycast a simple 2d scene and render it to the pimoroni pico display.

## Set-Up

This project relies upon the pimoroni pico display library, instructions on how to set this up can be found [here](https://github.com/pimoroni/pimoroni-pico#cc).

This project also relies upon the standard pico-sdk, instructions on how to set this up can be found [here](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/pico/getting-started-with-pico.pdf)

This repository contains both a stubbed example, and a full solution should you get stuck at any point.
